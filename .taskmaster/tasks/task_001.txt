# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Amplify Gen 2 CDK Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational Amplify Gen 2 project structure and configure CDK constructs in amplify/backend.ts
# Details:
Create or update amplify/backend.ts with proper TypeScript CDK infrastructure. Import necessary CDK constructs including @aws-cdk/aws-rds, @aws-cdk/aws-ec2, @aws-cdk/aws-dynamodb, and @aws-cdk/aws-secretsmanager. Set up the basic app structure following Amplify Gen 2 patterns. Ensure proper CDK version compatibility (v2.x) and TypeScript configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Verify amplify/backend.ts compiles without errors. Run 'npx cdk synth' to validate CDK configuration. Check that all required CDK dependencies are properly installed.
