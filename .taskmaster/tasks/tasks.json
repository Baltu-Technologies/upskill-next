Create Missing Secret: Use AWS CLI or Console to create the required secret\n2. Verify Aurora Details: Double-check cluster identifier and security group settings\n3. Deploy Infrastructure: Run `npx ampx sandbox` once prerequisites are met\n4.

New Comprehensive Lambda Role:\n- Created comprehensiveLambdaRole that consolidates common permissions\n- Uses AWS managed policies for VPC and basic execution\n- Includes all necessary permissions following least privilege\n\n3. Consolidated Database Authentication:\n- Single policy covering both auth and course RDS Proxy connections\n- IAM database authentication enabled across all database access\n- Proper ARN formatting for both proxy endpoints\n\n4. Fine-Grained DynamoDB Policies:\n- Separate read-only and full-access policies\n- DynamoDB Streams access for real-time processing\n- Covers all 3 tables (notifications, activity streams, analytics) and their GSIs\n\n5. Comprehensive Secrets Access:\n- Application secrets (JWT, session)\n- Database secrets (auth + course databases)\n- External service secrets (email, payment, storage, analytics)\n- KMS access for secret decryption\n\n6. Cross-Service Communication:\n- CloudWatch Logs for comprehensive logging\n- S3 access for file operations\n- SES for email sending\n- SNS for notifications\n\n7. Security Constraints:\n- Permission boundary policy with explicit allows and denies\n- Prevents IAM modifications, security group changes, VPC modifications\n- Documented role mapping with CloudFormation outputs\n\nDeployment Status: ✅ Successful deployment in ~1.5 minutes\nSecurity Compliance: ✅ All least privilege principles implemented\nDocumentation: ✅ Complete role mapping and purpose documentation\n</info added on 2025-07-02T05:58:59.811Z>",
