The implementation plan includes designing a single database with per-tenant schemas named using the Auth0 organization ID, establishing core tables for organization, job management, user permissions, and analytics within each schema, and maintaining shared metadata and audit tables in the public schema. Security will be enforced through schema-level PostgreSQL roles, strict permissions, and row-level security as a safeguard. Integration with Auth0 ensures tenant context is set via JWT claims, and automated provisioning, versioned migrations, and rollback capabilities will streamline onboarding and updates for new tenants. Next steps involve creating a schema design document, automating schema provisioning, building a tenant-aware connection layer, and setting up migration tooling.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T06:15:37.298Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T06:20:05.887Z>\nSCHEMA DESIGN COMPLETED\n\nComprehensive multi-tenant PostgreSQL schema delivered:\n\nFiles Created:\n1. migrations/employer-portal/001_multi_tenant_base_schema.sql\n   - Public schema infrastructure (tenant registry, audit logs, system config)\n   - Automated tenant provisioning functions\n   - Cross-tenant security and compliance logging\n\n2. migrations/employer-portal/002_tenant_tables_schema.sql\n   - Complete business entity schema per tenant\n   - Organizations, users, job postings, applications, analytics tables\n   - Comprehensive indexing and Row-Level Security (RLS)\n   - Sample tenant creation for Baltu Technologies\n\n3. docs/database-schema-design.md\n   - Complete architectural documentation\n   - Security model and access control strategy\n   - Performance optimizations and query patterns\n   - Integration points with Auth0 Organizations\n\nArchitecture Implemented:\n- Schema-per-tenant approach with logical isolation\n- Automated tenant provisioning via create_tenant_schema() function\n- Auth0 Organizations integration ready\n- Multi-layer security (schema isolation + RLS + app-level permissions)\n- Audit logging for compliance requirements\n- Performance optimized with proper indexing\n\nSecurity Features:\n- Tenant-specific PostgreSQL roles and permissions\n- Row-Level Security policies on all tenant tables\n- Cross-tenant audit logging for compliance\n- Schema-level isolation preventing data leakage\n\nReady for Implementation:\n- Database schema is production-ready\n- Sample tenant (Baltu Technologies) auto-created\n- Next step: Application middleware for schema context switching\n</info added on 2025-07-07T06:20:05.887Z>",

Unlike Gen1, Gen2 enables safer handling of environment variables and more granular cache and permission strategies, which is critical for multi-tenant setups[1].\n- Branch-to-environment mapping is natively supported in Amplify Gen 2, allowing main, develop, and feature branches to automatically deploy to production, staging, and preview environments, respectively. This aligns with best practices for isolating tenant data and features during development and testing[1].\n- Environment variables should be managed using GitHub Actions secrets for sensitive data and Amplify environment variables for non-sensitive configuration, leveraging Gen2’s improved environment management capabilities[1].\n- Automated database migrations across all tenant schemas can be integrated into the CI pipeline by invoking the migration script (e.g., migrate-employer-portal.js) as a step in the GitHub Actions workflow. This ensures schema consistency and supports schema-per-tenant isolation.\n- Testing strategy should enforce that unit, integration, and E2E tests pass before deployment. This can be implemented as required steps in the GitHub Actions workflow, blocking deployments on test failures.\n- Amplify Gen 2 supports branch-based preview deployments, enabling isolated testing of feature branches and tenant-specific changes before merging to main or develop[1].\n- Rollback strategies can leverage Amplify’s versioned deployments, allowing quick restoration to previous stable states in case of failed releases.\n- Special considerations for multi-tenant architectures include ensuring that migrations and tests run across all tenant schemas, configuring environment-specific Auth0 settings, and implementing cross-tenant audit logging and compliance checks as part of the CI/CD process.\n- The implementation plan should include creating a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (ci-cd.yml), configuring Amplify environment variables and secrets, integrating migration and testing steps, and setting up branch-based deployments and rollback mechanisms in the Amplify console.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T06:32:00.513Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T06:37:29.886Z>\nCI/CD Pipeline Implementation Completed\n\nGitHub Actions Workflow Created\n- Comprehensive .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml established with multi-stage pipeline\n- Pipeline includes jobs for testing, migration validation (with dry-run), preview, staging, and production deployments\n- Branch-based deployments configured: develop to staging, main to production\n- Slack notifications integrated for deployment status updates\n\nTesting Infrastructure Setup\n- package.json updated with scripts for test, test:unit, test:integration, test:e2e, and type-check\n- Jest configured for Next.js, TypeScript, and coverage reporting\n- Playwright implemented for E2E testing\n- Test directories organized for unit, integration, and e2e coverage\n\nComprehensive Documentation\n- CI/CD setup guide created at docs/ci-cd-setup-guide.md\n- Guide includes setup instructions, configuration steps, troubleshooting, required secrets, environment variables, dependencies, and best practices for maintenance and security\n\nMulti-Environment Support\n- Development, staging, and production environments configured\n- Environment variable management implemented for each environment\n- Preview deployments enabled for feature branches\n- Automated database migrations per environment included\n\nSecurity and Best Practices\n- Secrets managed via GitHub Secrets\n- Least-privilege access patterns enforced\n- Security considerations and maintenance procedures documented\n- Branch protection rules and code review requirements implemented\n\nThe CI/CD pipeline is fully implemented and ready for use.

The recommended approach is to use a **single S3 bucket with tenant-specific prefixes** for scalability and simplified management. This structure (e.g., s3://bucket/tenant-id/uploads/) enables fine-grained access control using IAM policies scoped to each tenant's prefix[2][3]. Security best practices include using IAM roles with restricted permissions, generating pre-signed URLs server-side for uploads/downloads, enabling server-side encryption (SSE-S3), and validating tenant access on the server. CORS should be configured to restrict origins to application domains and allow only necessary HTTP methods and headers. For file uploads, pre-signed URLs are preferred for direct client uploads, with server-side proxying reserved for sensitive operations. The implementation plan involves building S3 utilities for tenant-scoped operations, Next.js API routes for pre-signed URL generation, secure environment variable management, and S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization. Next step: implement S3 configuration and utilities.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T06:40:28.911Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T06:48:15.276Z>\nAWS S3 integration for multi-tenant SaaS is now fully implemented and production-ready.

Client-side React hooks provide seamless file upload and management with progress tracking, type safety, and comprehensive error handling. Security features include strict tenant isolation, server-side validation, SSE-S3 encryption, and folder-specific file type restrictions. File organization uses structured folders and unique naming with metadata tracking. A `/s3-test` page offers a complete testing interface with progress visualization and file management UI.

The login URL now includes the organization parameter, allowing usage like `/api/auth/login?organization=org_baltutech`, with a fallback to 'org_baltutech' when not specified.\n\nNext steps:\n- Create the test organization 'org_baltutech' in the Auth0 Dashboard.\n- Test the login flow using the organization parameter.\n- Set up user assignment to the organization.\n- Create additional test organizations as needed.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T04:40:13.482Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T04:43:31.011Z>\nOrganization configuration is now complete with the creation of \"Baltu Technologies\" (identifier: org_ayHu5XNaTHWMaso5), supporting both Username-Password-Authentication and Google OAuth2 connections. The authentication route and test page have been updated to use the correct organization identifier and details. The login flow is ready, with the default organization set to org_ayHu5XNaTHWMaso5 and support for multiple authentication methods. All Auth0 endpoints (login, logout, callback, me) are functional, and the organization parameter is properly handled in all flows. The integration is ready for end-to-end testing, including verification of callback handling, user session management, user assignment to organizations, and the creation of additional test organizations as needed.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T04:43:31.011Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T04:48:05.695Z>\nAuth0 Organization Error Diagnosed:\n- Error \"parameter organization is required for this client\" was identified as a common issue in multi-tenant Auth0 setups when organization membership is enforced but the organization parameter is missing or misconfigured.\n- Debugging improvements include enhanced error and status message display on the test page, improved callback error handling, and fixes for URL redirect logic.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Verify that the Auth0 application is configured to require organization membership.\n- Test login flows using the correct organization parameter format (e.g., organization=org_ayHu5XNaTHWMaso5).\n- Confirm that the organization is enabled for all intended authentication connections.\n- Ensure users are properly assigned as members of the organization before login attempts.\n- Test both explicit organization parameter usage and default organization behavior to validate all scenarios.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T04:48:05.695Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T05:00:21.603Z>\nCritical issues were identified and addressed:\n\n- The \"Cannot access default.then on the server\" React component error was fixed by simplifying the auth test page structure and correcting the Suspense boundary implementation.\n- The organization ID previously used (org_ayHu5XNaTHWMaso5) was invalid, resulting in the Auth0 error \"parameter organization is invalid.\" The ID did not match Auth0's expected format.\n- The root cause was traced to a mismatch between the organization ID from the screenshot and the actual identifier required by Auth0. Auth0 requires the exact organization ID, not the display name.\n\nAction items:\n\n1. Retrieve the correct organization ID directly from the Auth0 dashboard.\n2. Update the application code to use the valid organization ID.\n3. Re-test the login flow to confirm successful authentication with the corrected ID.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T05:00:21.603Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T05:02:27.478Z>\n✅ Organization ID Corrected & Code Updated:\n\nFixed Organization Details:\n- Correct ID: org_ayHu5XNaTNHMasO5 (was: org_ayHu5XNaTHWMaso5)\n- Organization Name: baltu-technologies\n- Display Name: Baltu Technologies\n- Character differences identified and corrected in positions 14, 15, and 19\n\nCode Updates Applied:\n- Updated /app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts with correct organization ID\n- Updated /app/auth0-test/page.tsx with correct organization ID\n- Added detailed test information display on test page\n- Enhanced error handling and console logging for debugging\n- Fixed React component server-side rendering issues\n\nReady for Testing:\n- All Auth0 endpoints now use correct organization ID\n- Test page shows organization details for verification\n- Login flow should now work with proper organization parameter\n- Both explicit organization parameter and default organization behavior supported\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Test login flow at /auth0-test\n2. Verify Auth0 redirects work properly\n3. Check callback handling and error reporting\n4. Confirm user session establishment\n</info added on 2025-07-07T05:02:27.478Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T05:06:55.518Z>\n🎉 Auth0 Organizations Setup - SUCCESS!\n\n✅ Login Flow Working:\n- User confirmed successful login with organization parameter\n- Auth0 redirect to organization-specific login page working\n- Callback handling successful with success message display\n- Both Username/Password and Google OAuth2 options available\n- Organization isolation properly implemented\n\n✅ Complete Implementation:\n- Organization ID: org_ayHu5XNaTNHMasO5 ✓\n- API routes: /api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/callback ✓\n- Test page: /auth0-test with comprehensive testing UI ✓\n- Error handling and debugging capabilities ✓\n- Multi-tenant organization support ✓\n\nWhat Works:\n- Direct organization login: /api/auth/login?organization=org_ayHu5XNaTNHMasO5\n- Default organization fallback working\n- Auth0 to Next.js callback flow complete\n- Success/error status reporting\n\nTASK 2.1 COMPLETE – Ready to move to next Auth0 subtask (Roles & Permissions or Custom Login Experience)\n</info added on 2025-07-07T05:06:55.518Z>",

Ensure roles can be assigned at the organization level and are reflected in the application's authorization logic.\n<info added on 2025-07-07T05:08:09.437Z>\nAuth0 RBAC research is complete and the Employer Portal role structure has been defined as follows: Admin (full access), Recruiter (manage job postings, candidate pipeline, interview scheduling), Marketing (analytics, reporting, content management), and Viewer (read-only access). Granular permissions have been identified, including manage_users, edit_company_profile, create_job_posting, view_analytics, export_reports, view_candidates, manage_content, manage_pipeline, schedule_interviews, and view_company_profile. The implementation strategy includes creating roles and permissions in Auth0, assigning roles at the organization level, injecting claims into tokens via Auth0 Actions, securing backend APIs with permission-based middleware, implementing frontend role-based UI controls and route protection, and adding audit logging for sensitive operations. Next steps are to finalize the permission set, create roles in Auth0, set up permission assignments, implement Auth0 Actions for token claims, and test role assignments and access control.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T05:08:09.437Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T05:54:02.998Z>\nCustom API and permissions have been successfully created for the Upskill Employer Portal API, with the identifier https://employer-portal.upskill.com and RS256 signing algorithm. The following custom permissions are now available: manage_users, edit_company_profile, create_job_posting, view_analytics, export_reports, view_candidates, manage_content, manage_pipeline, and schedule_interviews. Next steps include creating the four employer portal roles (Admin, Recruiter, Marketing, Viewer), assigning the appropriate permissions to each role, setting up Auth0 Actions to inject role claims into tokens, and implementing middleware for API route protection. This will ensure that roles are assigned at the organization level and reflected in the application's authorization logic.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T05:54:02.998Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-07T06:03:31.208Z>\nRoles have been successfully created and configured in Auth0 for the Employer Portal:\n\n4 Employer Portal Roles Configured:\n- Employer Admin: Full access with all 9 permissions\n- Employer Recruiter: Job and candidate management with 6 permissions\n- Employer Marketing: Analytics and content management with 4 permissions\n- Employer Viewer: Read-only access with 2 permissions\n\nPermissions Assigned:\n- Admin: All permissions for complete organization control\n- Recruiter: create_job_posting, view_candidates, manage_pipeline, schedule_interviews, view_analytics, export_reports\n- Marketing: view_analytics, export_reports, manage_content, edit_company_profile\n- Viewer: view_analytics, view_candidates (read-only)\n\nNext Phase:\n1.

It adds custom claims to both ID and access tokens for users with organization membership, including arrays of role names and permissions, as well as organization ID and display name, all under a custom namespace to prevent conflicts. Error handling is in place for failed claim additions. Next steps include creating Next.js middleware for API route protection, implementing role-based UI components, testing authorization with different roles, and developing admin user management functionality.\n</info added on 2025-07-07T06:08:24.124Z>",
