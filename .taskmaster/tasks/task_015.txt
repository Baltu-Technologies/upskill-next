# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for backend deployment and testing
# Details:
Create/update amplify.yml for backend deployment via 'amplify push --yes'. Configure preBuild (npm ci), backendBuild (amplify push), build (npm run build), and postBuild (connection testing) phases. Implement efficient caching strategy for node_modules. Set up proper build artifact handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete pipeline execution, backend deployment, database migrations, and connection testing. Verify build performance and caching effectiveness. Test deployment across different environments.
