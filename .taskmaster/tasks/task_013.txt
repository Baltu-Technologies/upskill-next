# Task ID: 13
# Title: Configure Amplify Environment Variables and Secrets
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Amplify environment variable injection from Secrets Manager
# Details:
Configure Amplify Console environment variables for database URLs (AUTH_DB_URL, COURSE_DB_URL), AWS_REGION, and other runtime configuration. Link secrets from Secrets Manager to Amplify environment. Ensure runtime-only injection to prevent exposure in client bundles.

# Test Strategy:
Verify environment variable injection in both development and production. Test secret access and application startup. Validate that sensitive data is not exposed in client-side code.
