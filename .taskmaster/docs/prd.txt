# Skills Inventory ("My Skills") ‚Äì Product Requirements Document

*Last updated: 2025‚Äë01‚Äë05*

## Purpose & Problem Statement

Many entry‚Äëlevel learners in technical pathways (semiconductor, robotics, data‚Äëcenter operations, etc.) possess a fragmented mix of **formal skills** (courses, certifications, on‚Äëthe‚Äëjob training) and **informal skills** (hobby projects, self‚Äëstudy, maker activities). Employers need a verifiable, machine‚Äëreadable snapshot of this whole‚Äëperson skillset. The "My Skills" module will:

* Enable users to inventory **all** their skills with appropriate evidence.
* Give employers data they can filter by skill, confidence, verification, and evidence.
* Provide admins an iterative taxonomy that grows as new skills emerge.

## Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal                            | Metric                                                       | Target              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Capture complete skill profiles | ‚â• 70 % of active learners reach ‚â• 80 % module completion     | 90 days post‚Äëlaunch |
| Increase employer engagement    | Avg. ‚â• 3 skill‚Äëbased candidate filters per employer per week | 60 days post‚Äëlaunch |
| Maintain data quality           | ‚â§ 10 % of skills in "other/free‚Äëtext" bucket after 6 months  | Ongoing             |

## Personas & Use Cases

* **Learner/Job Seeker** ‚Äì wants to showcase every relevant ability, get hired faster.
* **Hiring Manager** ‚Äì needs to filter candidates by verified skills/evidence.
* **Instructor/Mentor** ‚Äì endorses student skills and assigns evidence.
* **Platform Admin** ‚Äì curates taxonomy, merges duplicates, reviews clustering suggestions.

## User Experience & Flow

1. **Landing Panel** ‚Äì progress bar + CTA "Add / Edit Skills".
2. **Guided Domains** (accordion): Electronics, Mechatronics, Programming, Safety, Soft Skills.
   * Checklist items with confidence (0‚Äë4), learned‚Äëthrough, evidence upload.
   * "Add Other" at end of each domain.
3. **Free‚ÄëForm Section** ‚Äì mini‚Äëform for entirely new skills with auto‚Äësuggest.
4. **Review & Save** ‚Äì table summary ‚Üí submit; system validates + writes via bulk API.
5. **Optional Endorsement** ‚Äì employer/instructor receives link to verify pending skills.

*Progress nudges*: banners after login ("Add two more skills to reach 80 % completeness").

## Functional Requirements

|  ID  | Requirement                                                              | Priority |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| F‚Äë1  | Display guided domain list with pre‚Äëseeded skills                        | Must     |
| F‚Äë2  | Allow user confidence selection (0‚Äì4) per skill                          | Must     |
| F‚Äë3  | Accept evidence file/URL attach ‚â§ 20 MB                                  | Must     |
| F‚Äë4  | Support free‚Äëtext skill entry with auto‚Äësuggest                          | Must     |
| F‚Äë5  | Persist skills via **PATCH /users/{id}/skills** (bulk add/update/delete) | Must     |
| F‚Äë6  | Auto‚Äëpopulate verified skills when a course module is completed          | Must     |
| F‚Äë7  | Progress computation formula (verified + claimed √∑ core total)           | Must     |
| F‚Äë8  | Admin dashboard to view "unmatched skills" & merge/approve               | Should   |
| F‚Äë9  | Nightly AI clustering job to suggest taxonomy additions                  | Should   |
| F‚Äë10 | Endorsement workflow (email & in‚Äëapp notification)                       | Could    |

## Non‚ÄëFunctional Requirements

* **Security** ‚Äì File uploads scanned; RBAC so only owner, endorsed mentors, and employers with permission see evidence.
* **Performance** ‚Äì Save/Load ‚â§ 300 ms median; clustering batch ‚â§ 10 min nightly.
* **Accessibility** ‚Äì WCAG 2.2 AA.

## Data Model (simplified)

```
UserSkill
  skill_id   UUID PK
  user_id    UUID FK
  name       TEXT
  category   TEXT
  source_type ENUM('formal','informal','auto_verified')
  learned_through TEXT
  confidence SMALLINT 0‚Äë4
  evidence_url TEXT
  endorsement_status ENUM('none','pending','verified')
  created_at TIMESTAMP
```

*Taxonomy tables*: `SkillTemplate`, `SkillAlias`.

## API End‚Äëpoints

* **GET /users/{id}/skills** ‚Äì returns array of `UserSkill`.
* **PATCH /users/{id}/skills** ‚Äì body `{add:[‚Ä¶], update:[‚Ä¶], delete:[‚Ä¶]}`.
* **POST /skills/endorse** ‚Äì body `{skill_id, endorser_id, action}`.

## Analytics & Reporting

* Skill coverage heat‚Äëmap by pathway.
* Employer search logs (top 20 filtered skills per month).
* Free‚Äëtext skill volume & clustering accuracy rate.

## Roll‚Äëout Plan

| Phase       | Scope                                                                                    | ETA      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **MVP**     | Guided domains, free‚Äëform add, evidence upload, progress bar, auto‚Äëpopulate from courses |  Q3‚Äë2025 |
| **Phase 2** | Endorsements, admin clustering UI, employer filter integration                           |  Q4‚Äë2025 |
| **Phase 3** | AI skill gap recommendations, printable skill summary PDF                                |  Q1‚Äë2026 |

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Low evidence attachment rate** ‚Üí make evidence optional but nudge with tooltips and badge rewards.
* **Taxonomy sprawl** ‚Üí weekly admin curation + AI dedupe.
* **User overwhelm** ‚Üí start with ‚â§ 5 domains, progressive disclosure of sub‚Äëskills.

## Open Questions

1. Maximum storage quota per user for evidence?
2. Do we allow video embeds (YouTube) vs. raw uploads only?
3. How will soft‚Äëskill endorsements be captured‚Äînumerical rating or textual feedback?
4. Should confidence scores be visible to employers or used only as an internal weighting?
