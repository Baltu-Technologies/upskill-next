# AI-Enhanced Course Creator

The AI-Enhanced Course Creator provides intelligent text suggestions throughout the course creation workflow, helping instructors develop professional, industry-appropriate training content faster and more effectively.

## üéØ Course Context Foundation

The system includes a foundational **Course Context** system that ensures all AI suggestions are aligned with specific job requirements and course structure guidelines. This context is automatically injected into every AI prompt throughout the course creation process.

### Context Components

#### 1. Job Description & Knowledge Standards
- Upload PDFs, text files, or enter manual text
- Includes job descriptions, curriculum standards, learning objectives
- Defines what skills and knowledge the course should cover
- Supports industry standards and compliance requirements

#### 2. Course Structure Guidelines
- Master guidelines for content creation consistency
- System prompts that structure learning progression
- Ensures proper content sequencing and dependencies
- Prevents microlessons from referencing uncreated material

### Context Features
- **File Upload Support**: PDF, TXT, MD files up to 10MB
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Easy file management
- **Manual Text Entry**: Direct text input for context
- **Context Preview**: Real-time preview of loaded content
- **Persistent Context**: Automatically included in all AI suggestions

## üéØ Features

### Smart Text Suggestions
- **Contextual AI**: Suggestions are tailored based on industry, skill level, and existing content
- **Non-destructive**: Original text is never replaced automatically
- **Accept/Decline Interface**: Review and selectively choose suggestions
- **Real-time Context**: AI considers all related fields when generating suggestions
- **Clear & Concise**: AI emphasizes simple, direct language that's easy to understand

### Inline Editing
- **Edit Learning Outcomes**: Click the edit button to modify individual learning outcomes
- **Edit Prerequisites**: Click the edit button to modify individual prerequisites
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press Enter to save or Escape to cancel editing
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately reflected in the course data

### Auto-Generated Tags
- **Intelligent Categorization**: Automatically generates relevant tags for course discovery
- **Industry-Specific**: Tags focus on technical skills, tools, equipment, and safety aspects
- **Editable**: All generated tags can be modified or removed manually

### Duration Management
- **Hours-Based**: All durations are measured in hours for consistency and clarity
- **Course Duration**: Total learning time in hours (e.g., 8, 24, 40)
- **Lesson Duration**: Individual lesson time in hours (e.g., 2, 4, 8)
- **Auto-Generated**: Durations are automatically calculated based on course content and complexity

### Supported Fields
- **Course Title**: Professional, engaging course names
- **Course Description**: Comprehensive overviews focused on practical outcomes
- **Learning Outcomes**: Specific, measurable objectives using action verbs
- **Prerequisites**: Realistic skill and knowledge requirements
- **Lesson Titles**: Concise, action-oriented lesson names
- **Lesson Descriptions**: Brief summaries of lesson content
- **Lesson Objectives**: Specific learning goals for individual lessons

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Course Context Setup
Before creating content, set up your course context:

1. **Upload Job Description**: Add job descriptions, knowledge standards, or curriculum requirements
2. **Define Course Structure**: Provide guidelines for content organization and progression
3. **File Support**: Upload PDF, TXT, or MD files, or enter text manually

### 2. AI Auto-Generation Workflow
The system now supports automatic course generation from context:

1. **Complete Course Context**: Ensure both job description and course structure are provided
2. **Generate Course Info**: Click "Next" to auto-generate course title, description, learning outcomes, and prerequisites
3. **Generate Lesson Structure**: After reviewing course info, click "Next" to auto-generate comprehensive lesson plans
4. **Review and Edit**: All generated content is editable and can be refined

### 3. Manual Enhancement
For detailed customization, use the AI-enhanced text inputs:

1. **Enter Initial Content**: Type your draft text in any field
2. **Request Suggestions**: Click the ‚ú® (Sparkles) button next to the field
3. **Review Options**: AI will provide 2-3 contextual suggestions
4. **Accept or Decline**: 
   - Click ‚úÖ to replace your text with a suggestion
   - Click ‚ùå to remove a suggestion from the list
   - Click ‚Üª to generate new suggestions

### 4. Setting Up
Ensure you have an OpenAI API key configured in your environment:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Creating Suggestions

1. **Enter Initial Content**: Type your draft text in any field
2. **Request Suggestions**: Click the ‚ú® (Sparkles) button next to the field
3. **Review Options**: AI will provide 2-3 contextual suggestions
4. **Accept or Decline**: 
   - Click ‚úÖ to replace your text with a suggestion
   - Click ‚ùå to remove a suggestion from the list
   - Click ‚Üª to generate new suggestions

### 3. Best Practices

**For Better Suggestions:**
- Provide some initial text rather than starting completely blank
- Fill out related fields (industry, skill level) for better context
- Use descriptive course/lesson titles to help AI understand scope

**Workflow Tips:**
- Start with course-level information before lesson details
- Review all suggestions before accepting
- Use suggestions as inspiration rather than exact replacements
- Combine multiple suggestions to create ideal content
