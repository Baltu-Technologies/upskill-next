# Cursor Rule: Require Explicit Git Consent

## Rule ID
explicit-git-consent

## Description
Cursor must not automatically commit or push any changes to GitHub (or any remote) without first obtaining **explicit permission** from the user.

## Behavior

- Before executing any `git commit`, `git add`  or `git push`, Cursor must **prompt the user for confirmation**.
- If the user does **not explicitly approve**, the action must be **canceled**.
- Cursor should clearly articulate what will be committed or pushed before asking.

## Rationale

- Community discussions widely emphasize the importance of **human-in-the-loop confirmation** before bypassing Git safeguards or executing version control actionsâ€”especially for push operations :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- Pre-push hooks and IDE integrations often include an explicit confirmation step to prevent unintended actions :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
